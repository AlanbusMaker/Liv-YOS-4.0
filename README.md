# Liv YOS 4.0

Welcome to Liv YOS 4.0 Files!
Liv YOS 4.0 is a open-source project, and I created this repository.
Includes:
- LivTexti (use "seu_arquivo.c" to modify)
- Impresser (the same as LivTexti, now the file is "impresser_pro.c")
- Viwert (use "viwert.c" to modify)
And compiles with MinGW (Windows) or GCC (Linux).

# WARNING: THIS PROGRAMS IS FOR WINDOWS. IF YOU WILL COMPILE IN LINUX, EXECUTE IN A WINDOWS 32-BIT COMPUTER.
Thanks-you!
